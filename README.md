# PandaMouseHelper
Panda Mouse Pro Helper [ROOT] helps activating Panda Mouse Pro for android 12 without using a pc (your device must be rooted for activation) (On activation from panda mouse pro app itself, keyboard does not work in android 12, activation from this app will fix that :) ). So just deny superuser permissions to panda mouse pro app and give superuser permission to this app and press ACTIVATE button and you are all set!
